"#mon itor_old" 

[This is the "old" version of monitor.ioer.de](monitor.ioer.de)
---> the version that is currently online

I am having problems when updating its Frontend from the ["new" Frontend @https://github.com/ioer-dresden/ioer-monitor/tree/master](https://github.com/ioer-dresden/ioer-monitor/tree/master).
After copying/overwriting the "new" Frontend content into the "old" monitor, it always throws a "Flaechenschema.js not found" error. 
This error is not present on [monitor.ioer.de/monitor_test](monitor.ioer.de/monitor_test)
